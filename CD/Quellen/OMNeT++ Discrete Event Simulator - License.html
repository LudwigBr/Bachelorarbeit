<div itemprop="articleBody">
	<i> The following license governs the use of OMNeT++ in academic and 
educational environments. Commercial use requires a commercial license 
from SimulCraft  Inc, <a href="http://www.omnest.com/" mce_href="http://www.omnest.com" target="_blank">www.omnest.com</a>. </i>  <p align="center">ACADEMIC PUBLIC LICENSE</p>  <p align="center">Copyright (C) 2003, 2010 Andras Varga</p>  <br> <p align="center">Preamble</p>  <p>
  This license contains the terms and conditions of using OMNeT++ in 
noncommercial settings: at academic institutions for teaching and 
research use, and at non-profit research organizations. You will find 
that this license provides noncommercial users of OMNeT++ with rights 
that are similar to the well-known GNU General Public License, yet it 
retains the possibility for OMNeT++ authors to financially support the 
development by selling commercial licenses. In fact, if you intend to 
use OMNeT++ in a "for-profit" environment, where research is conducted 
to develop or enhance a product, is used in a commercial service 
offering, or when a commercial company uses OMNeT++ to participate in a 
research project (for example government-funded or EU-funded research 
projects), then you need to obtain a commercial license for OMNeT++. In 
that case, please contact the Author to inquire about commercial 
licenses.</p>  <p>  What are the rights given to noncommercial users? 
Similarly to GPL, you have the right to use the software, to distribute 
copies, to receive source code, to change the software and distribute 
your modifications or the modified software. Also similarly to the GPL, 
if you distribute verbatim or modified copies of this software, they 
must be distributed under this license.</p>  <p>  By modeling the GPL, 
this license guarantees that you're safe when using OMNeT++ in your 
work, for teaching or research. This license guarantees that OMNeT++ 
will remain available free of charge for nonprofit use. You can modify 
OMNeT++ to your purposes, and you can also share your modifications. 
Even in the unlikely case of the authors abandoning OMNeT++ entirely, 
this license permits anyone to continue developing it from the last 
release, and to create further releases under this license.</p>  <p>  We
 believe that the combination of noncommercial open-source and 
commercial licensing will be beneficial for the whole user community, 
because income from commercial licenses will enable faster development 
and a higher level of software quality, while further enjoying the 
informal, open communication and collaboration channels of open source 
development.</p>  <p>  The precise terms and conditions for using, copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>   <p align="center">                         ACADEMIC PUBLIC LICENSE</p>  <p align="center">    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>  <p>  0. Definitions</p>  <p>  "Program" means a copy of OMNeT++, which is said to be distributed under this Academic Public License.</p>  <p>
  "Work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative
 work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program
 or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included
 without limitation in the term "modification".)</p>  <p>  "Using the 
Program" means any act of creating executables that contain or directly 
use libraries that are part of the Program, running any of the tools 
that are part of the Program, or creating works based on the Program.</p>  <p>Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p>  <p>
  1. Permission is hereby granted to use the Program free of charge for 
any noncommercial purpose, including teaching and research at 
universities, colleges and other educational institutions, research at 
non-profit research institutions, and personal non-profit purposes. For 
using the Program for commercial purposes, including but not restricted 
to consulting activities, design of commercial hardware or software 
networking products, and a commercial entity participating in research 
projects, you have to contact the Author for an appropriate license. 
Permission is also granted to use the Program for a reasonably limited 
period of time for the purpose of evaluating its usefulness for a 
particular purpose.</p>  <p>  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim 
copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy 
an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact 
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any 
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this 
License along with the Program.</p><p>    3. You may modify your copy or
 copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based 
on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under
 the terms of Section 2 above, provided that you also meet all of these 
conditions:</p><ul><li>a) You must cause the modified files to carry 
prominent notices     stating that you changed the files and the date of
 any change.</li></ul><ul><li>b) You must cause any work that you 
distribute or publish, that in     whole or in part contains or is 
derived from the Program or any     part thereof, to be licensed as a 
whole at no charge to all third     parties under the terms of this 
License.</li></ul>  <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a
 whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the 
Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works
 in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you 
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
 the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
 License, whose regulations for other licensees extend to the entire 
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. (If 
the same, independent sections are distributed as part of a package that
 is otherwise reliant on, or is based on the Program, then the 
distribution of the whole package, including but not restricted to the 
independent section, must be on the unmodified terms of this License, 
regadless of who the author of the included sections was.)</p>  <p>Thus,
 it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
collective works based or reliant on the Program.</p>  <p>In addition, 
mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the 
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of 
this License.</p>  <p>  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a
 work based on it, under Section 3) in object code or executable form 
under the terms of Sections 2 and 3 above provided that you also do one 
of the following:</p>  <ul><li>    a) Accompany it with the complete 
corresponding machine-readable     source code, which must be 
distributed under the terms of Sections     2 and 3 above on a medium 
customarily used for software interchange; or,</li></ul>  <ul><li>    b)
 Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three     years, 
to give any third party, for a charge no more than your     cost of 
physically performing source distribution, a complete     
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be     
distributed under the terms of Sections 2 and 3 above on a medium     
customarily used for software interchange; or,</li></ul>  <ul><li>    c)
 Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer     to 
distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is     allowed 
only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received     the 
program in object code or executable form with such an offer,     in 
accord with Subsection b) above.)</li></ul>  <p>The source code for a 
work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to 
it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all the source 
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and 
installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the 
source code distributed need not include anything that is normally 
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components 
(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the 
executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the 
executable.</p>  <p>If distribution of executable or object code is made
 by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering 
equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as 
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not 
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>  <p>  5. 
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except 
as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to 
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will 
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
 who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will 
not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in 
full compliance.</p>  <p>  6. You are not required to accept this 
License, since you have not signed it.  Nothing else grants you 
permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works; 
law prohibits these actions if you do not accept this License.  
Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based 
on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License and all 
its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the 
Program or works based on it, to do so.</p>  <p>  7. Each time you 
redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the 
recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
 copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and 
conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the 
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not 
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</p>  <p>
  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot 
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license
 would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all 
those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the 
only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain 
entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>  <p>If any portion of 
this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular 
circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the 
section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>  <p>
  9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program are restricted in 
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the 
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may 
add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those 
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries 
not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the 
limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>  <p align="center">                            NO WARRANTY</p>  <p>
  10. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO 
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR 
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE
 ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH 
YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL 
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>  <p>  11. IN NO EVENT 
UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED ON IN WRITING WILL ANY 
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE 
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING 
ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
 THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY 
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY 
OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF 
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>  <p align="center">                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>  <span><i>NOTE In case the above text differs from the license file in the source distribution, the latter is the valid one.</i></span></div>
